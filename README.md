# Work-Day-Planner
A dynamically updated planner application, using HTML, CSS and jQuery to enter and save the current day's work using third party APIs.

This app uses Moment.js' library to work with date and time. 

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
## Features

This app : 

* Displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner. 

* Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down. 

*Includes color-coded timeblocks based on past, present and future when the timeblock is viewed. 

## Future Development 

I would like to add local storage to each text input element in order that user information is stored and retrieved and displayed in the form element and does not disappear on page reload.
